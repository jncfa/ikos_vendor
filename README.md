# ikos_vendor

Vendored package for IKOS (Inference Kernel for Open Static Analyzers) from NASA.

Since the IKOS creates a virtualenv to [run its tools](https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/ikos/blob/master/analyzer/CMakeLists.txt#L343-L373), you need to clone this package locally for it to properly work.
